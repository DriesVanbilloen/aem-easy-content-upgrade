# AEM Easy Content Upgrade (AECU)

AECU simplifies content migrations by executing migration scripts during package installation. It is built on top of [Groovy Console](https://github.com/OlsonDigital/aem-groovy-console).


Features:

* GUI to run scripts and see history of runs
* Run mode support
* Fallback scripts in case of errors
* Extension of Groovy Console bindings
* Service API
* Health Checks

# Requirements

AECU requires Java 8 and AEM 6.3 or above. Groovy Console can be installed manually if [bundle install](#bundleInstall) is not used.

# Installation

## Bundle Installation

To simplify installation we provide a bundle package that already includes the Groovy Console. This makes sure there are no compatibility issues.

# JMX Interface

<img src="docs/images/jmx.png">

AECU provides JMX methods for executing scripts and reading the history. You can also check the version here.

## Execute

This will execute the given script or folder. If a folder is specified then all files (incl. any subfolders) are executed. AECU will respect runmodes during execution.

Parameters:
 * Path: file or folder to execute

## GetHistory

Prints the history of the specified last runs. The entries are sorted by date and start with the last run.

Parameters:
 * Start index: starts with 0 (= latest history entry)
 * Count: number of entries to print

## GetFiles

This will print all files that are executable for a given path. You can use this to check which scripts of a given folder would be executed.

Parameters:
* Path: file or folder to check


# Health Checks

Health checks show you the status of AECU itself and the last migration run.
You can access them on the [status page](http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/operations/content/healthreports/healthreportlist.html/system/sling/monitoring/mbeans/org/apache/sling/healthcheck/HealthCheck/aecuHealthCheckmBean).
For the status of older runs use AECU's history page.
